    "**The Earth Engine API**\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for scientific data analysis. It provides ready-to-use, cloud-hosted datasets and a large pool of servers. One feature that makes Earth Engine particularly attractive is the ability to run large computations very fast by distributing them across a large pool of servers. The ability to efficiently use cloud-hosted datasets and computation is enabled by the Earth Engine API.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is a way to communicate with Earth Engine servers. It allows you to specify what computation you would like to do, and then to receive the results. The API is designed so that users do not need to worry about how the computation is distributed across a cluster of machines and the results are assembled. Users of the API simply specify what needs to be done. This greatly simplifies the code by hiding the implementation detail from the users. It also makes Earth Engine very approachable for users who are not familiar with writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth Engine API is designed to be language agnostic. Google provides official client libraries to use the API from both JavaScript and Python. The API remains largely the same regardless of the programming language you use. The main difference is the syntax used to call the API functions. Once you learn the syntax for programming languages, your code can be adapted easily because they all use the same API functions."

    "**Why JavaScript?**\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript may not be the first choice of programming language for many researchers and data scientists, and some may be wondering why this book is based on the JavaScript API instead of Python or R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth Engine JavaScript API is the most mature and easiest to use when getting started. The Earth Engine platform comes with a web-based Code Editor that allows you to start using the Earth Engine JavaScript API without any installation. It also provides additional functionality to display your results on a map, save your scripts, access documentation, manage tasks, and more. It has a one-click mechanism to share your code with other users—allowing for easy reproducibility and collaboration. In addition, the JavaScript API comes with a user interface library, which allows you to create charts and web-based applications with little effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you do not need to become a JavaScript expert to use Earth Engine. The basic syntax described here should be sufficient. A good tip is that if you find yourself doing something complicated in JavaScript, it might be done much better in Earth Engine. All the important computations in Earth Engine need to use the API functions, and even a basic operation—such as adding two numbers in Earth Engine—should be done using the Earth Engine API. "

You are free to use either **'** (single quotes) or **\"** (double quotes), and they must match at the beginning and end of each string. In your programs, it is advisable to be consistent—use either single quotes or double quotes throughout a given script (the code in this book generally uses single quotes for code). Each statement of your script should typically end with a semicolon, although Earth Engine’s code editor does not require it."

You can create a dictionary using the curly braces `{}`. The code below creates an object called `cityData` with some information about San Francisco. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note a few important things about the JavaScript syntax here. First, we can use multiple lines to define the object. Only when we put in the semicolon (`;`) is the command considered complete. This helps format the code to make it more readable. Also note the choice of the variable name `cityData`. The variable contains two words. The first word is in lowercase, and the first letter of the second word is capitalized. This type of naming scheme of joining multiple words into a single variable name is called “camel case.” While it is not mandatory to name your variables using this scheme, it is considered a good practice to follow. Functions and parameters in the Earth Engine API follow this convention, so your code will be much more readable if you follow it too."

    "In @sec-get-started-code-editor, you learned how to store numbers in variables, but not how to do any computation. This is because when you use Earth Engine, you do not do addition using JavaScript operators. For example, you would not write “var c = a + b” to add the two numbers. Instead, the Earth Engine API provides you with functions to do this, and it is important that you use the API functions whenever you can. It may seem awkward at first, but using the functions, as we’ll describe below, will help you avoid timeouts and create efficient code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the **Docs** tab, you will find a group of methods that can be called on an `ee.Number`. Expand it to see the various functions available to work with numbers.
